# [Manjaro Linux JP](https://osdn.net/projects/manjaro-jp/)

## Japanese language support for [Manjaro Linux](https://manjaro.org/)
ã€€Supports Japanese input and display by default, including live environment.  
[kernel-6.1 series](https://kernel.org/).

KDE, Xfce and GNOME will be available for official use.  
The distribution files are ISO and some package files.  
Please boot from a USB memory stick, etc.  
It may be easier to use [Ventoy](https://ventoy.net/) to boot from USB memory.  
It is recommended to reformat the first partition with ext4 when installing Ventoy.

### Main Features
The Linux kernel is as up-to-date as possible.  
The kernel is built using clang.  
Japanese input (fcitx5-mozc) and Japanese fonts are installed as standard.  
The flatpak version [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/ja/firefox/browsers/) or [Floorp](https://floorp.ablaze.one/) is used as the standard browser.  
Standard installation of the flatpak version [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org) as office software.  

ISOs for live environment & installation are available at the following distribution sites.  
Please try it if you like.

##### Notes
1. secure boot is not supported.  
Please disable Secure Boot in your BIOS settings.
(If you want secure boot support, Ubuntu is a fast option, and Ubuntu Flavour offers several desktop environments). 

2. if the installer screen disappears during installation  
It can often be avoided by manually setting the swap partition.  
If the swap partition is /dev/sdX, try enabling swap manually with the following command.
```
sudo mkswap /dev/sdX
sudo swapon /dev/sdX
```

### Memorandum
##### manjaro-tools-iso changes
1. the first line of the mirrorlist is used as standard for where to get the packages used for buildiso.  
By default, the mirrorlist is not loaded and the EU server is used.
2. to prioritize the order of repositories specified in user-repos.conf in order to include the packages I have prepared in the ISO.  
This is mainly to include the latest version of the kernel.
