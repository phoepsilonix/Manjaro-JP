# [Manjaro Linux JP](https://osdn.net/projects/manjaro-jp/)

## Japanese language support for [Manjaro Linux](https://manjaro.org/)
ã€€Supports Japanese input and display by default, including live environment.
[kernel-5.18 series](https://kernel.org/).
5.17.15 (EOL) will also be built and distributed at OSDN.

GNOME, KDE, and Xfce will be available for official use.
The distribution files are ISO and some package files.
Please boot from a USB memory stick, etc. 
It may be easier to use [Ventoy](https://ventoy.net/) to boot from USB memory.
It is recommended to reformat the first partition with ext4 when installing Ventoy.

### Main Features
The Linux kernel is as up-to-date as possible.
The kernel is built using clang.
Japanese input (fcitx5-mozc) and Japanese fonts are installed as standard.
Use [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/) as the standard browser.
Standard installation of [libreoffice-fresh](https://www.libreoffice.org) as office software.

ISOs for live environment & installation are available at the following distribution sites.
Please try it if you like.

##### Notes
1. secure boot is not supported
Please disable Secure Boot in your BIOS settings.
(If you want secure boot support, Ubuntu is a fast option, and Ubuntu Flavour offers several desktop environments). 

2. if Vivaldi displays an error message about insufficient video codecs
You may get an error message that there is not enough h.264 codec to play the video.
This is because it may take some time for Vivaldi to update its components. After a while, it will be updated automatically.
You can also manually update the Vivaldi components by going to [Vivaldi components screen ( vivaldi://components )](vivaldi://components). 

3. if the startup menu does not appear
The menu can be displayed by modifying /etc/default/grub and executing update-grub. 
The fix is to change GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE from hidden to menu.
After that, if you run update-grub with administrator privileges, the menu will be displayed from the next boot. If the file system is btrfs, you can choose to boot from snapshots, etc.
Change GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=menu.
Set TIMEOUT to an appropriate number of seconds.
```sh
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
```

Then, execute the following command.
```sh
sudo update-grub
```

### Memorandum
##### manjaro-tools-iso changes
1. the first line of the mirrorlist is used as standard for where to get the packages used for buildiso.
By default, the mirrorlist is not loaded and the EU server is used.
2. to prioritize the order of repositories specified in user-repos.conf in order to include the packages I have prepared in the ISO. This is mainly to include the latest version of the kernel.

Addendum for your reference.
If you have a PC with Linux installed, you can use an unofficial (no official support) dual boot environment with ChromeOS. If you have a PC with Linux installed, you can create a dual-boot environment with ChromeOS, which is unofficial (no official support). This is for those who have some knowledge.
